Hello, my name is Chidiebube but you can all me Omooba. I'm a mobile app developer, currently I do cross-platform development with Flutter but I'm hoping to specialize in iOS development full-time someday. I write Python for fun and I'm a big time tech entusiast.
I'm hoping to collaborate on a Flutter project or maybe just a fun Python GUI project.
